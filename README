This repository contain the files I use for configuring my Emacs; the
relevant files are:

- init.el :: Entry point, just moves control to org-babel as quickly
             as possible;
- custom.el :: The file Emacs writes too when using
               =customize=. Typically I move items in here to
               =mrb.org=. When I reach my ideal configuration, this
               file will be empty, meaning everything is documented
               in =mrb.org=
- org-config.org :: This is what I include in orgmode files to
                    configure it. Basically contains a description of
                    the global workflow, behaviour and tags.
- mrb.org :: the main configuration document. This gets tangled into
             a =mrb.el= file on emacs startup automatically. The =mrb.org=
             file itself contains both documentation and code for the
             complete Emacs configuration.
